Exercise 1.4.  Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))


If b is less than zero then subtract b from a. If b is greater than zero add it to a.
This function has the behavior of taking the absolute value of b and adding it to a.
